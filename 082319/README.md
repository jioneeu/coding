### Ubuntu
I had an issue with the dual boot today that my Linux distro was overridden by Windows machine. So I was going re-install Ubuntu and I found this different distro of Ubuntu called Ubuntu Budgie.

### C#
- `Console.Write("TEXT");` prints a 'TEXT' to the console.
- `Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");` print a 'TEXT' to the console with a new line.
-  `System` is used for `Console`.

- Unlike C or C++, `char` type in C# is 16 bytes and there is another type reserved for 8 bytes data type called `byte' type.
